# Current Work

**Last updated:** 2026-05-07  
**Phase:** Phase 2 — Speaker Identification (in progress)

---

## Status

Updated `server/llm/prompts.py` — `build_system_prompt(user)` now accepts a speaker name. When the user is known, the prompt instructs the LLM to address them by name. When unknown, it instructs the LLM to ask who they are if asked something personal. `server/main.py` updated to pass `transcript.user` to `build_system_prompt`.

Next task: Enrollment — run enrollment script for Owner (physical action, requires Pi hardware).

## Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `requirements.md` | Full project requirements |
| `docs/architecture.md` | System design, hardware, resolved decisions |
| `docs/technical-stack.md` | Full stack with library choices and rationale |
| `docs/features.md` | Per-feature behavior specs |
| `plan.md` | **Phased implementation plan with checkboxes — agents work from here** |

## Agent Instructions

1. Read `plan.md`
2. Find the first unchecked item in the current active phase
3. Read `docs/technical-stack.md` for stack decisions before writing any code
4. Implement the item
5. Check it off in `plan.md` with a brief note
6. Continue until the phase is complete or a blocker is hit
7. Log blockers in the Blockers Log table at the bottom of `plan.md`

## Open Questions

1. **Wake word name** — TBD, not blocking Phase 1
2. **Tool sandboxing** — design decision for Phase 5, not blocking now
3. **Voice enrollment UX** — enrollment scripts exist; physical enrollment deferred until Pi hardware is set up

## Hardware Notes

- Server GPU upgrade pending: RTX 4060 Ti 16GB + 650W PSU (~$500)
- Until then: CPU inference with Llama 3.1 8B Q4
- After upgrade: switch Ollama model to Llama 3.1 13B Q4 in `config/settings.yaml`
